    Functions to creating the isoprene emissions estimates from my HCHO product

    Invert formaldehyde to Isoprene emissions using $\Omega_{HCHO} = S \times E_{ISOP} + B$
    Y_isop is the RMA regression between $k_{HCHO}*\Omega_{HCHO}$, and $k_{isop}*\Omega_{isop}$
    and $S = Y_{isop} / k_{HCHO}$
    B will be calculated from the remote pacific near the same latitude.
